# TeslaClone
Tesla Clone app is a clone of the official Tesla WebApp. This app basically enables users to buy a Tesla car ranging from the 3 current options. The Tesla Website uses a modern design for UI and experience which is quite preferable in today’s world which is full of clusters of unwanted designs.
Although you cannot literally buy the Tesla cars, this app is a great way to familiarize yourself with react native and its functionalities. The app is made through use of expo CLI and expo client apps for iOS and Android.

#Goals
The main goal of this app for me was to get familiar with modern UI techniques and be fluent in Cross Platform App Development frameworks. And through use of components in react native, which comes quite handy if you don’t want repetitive codes in your project.
